## Project Overview
This is my second java project.This project helps to calculate the SGPA(Semeste-GPA) for each semester and for calculating the CGPA(Cumulative-GPA) for all the semesters.Also it calculates the percentage and has the perfomance classification.This project is very close to real life academics because it helps the engineering students like me to calculate their Cgpa and check percentage,perfomance.

## Features
* Access multiple semesters

* Uses Scanner class for dynamic user input

* Uses arrays and nested loops for multiple subjects

* Conditional statements for calculating the grades

* Calculates SGPA for each semester

* Calculates final CGPA and Percentage

* Provides the perfomance classification

## Technologies used

* Language: Java
* Concepts:


  1.Arrays


  2.Nested Loops


  3.If-Else statements


  4.Scanner class(user input)
